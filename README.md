# Vincent-Rolin-unit-testing

## **Intro**

This is a learning challenge to develop and test our skills on unit testing.
We got provided the code/program to test and we need to create the unit test code to test this program. 

Below you can find back the **Learning Objectives** and some **instructions** for this challenge.

 *What, Why, When, How, Who.*

## **Learning Objectives¶**
You will learn how to take advantage of unit testing to create robust code. At the end of the challenge, you will be able to:

*Test your code with the assert python keyword
*Test your code with the unittest module
*Test your code with pytest module
*Use Mock objects
*Use other features from pytest

## **The Mission**
You work for a company working in Python. Your customer complains that your code crashes a lot and they're not able to access your services half of the time.

You see all the seniors of your company debugging all day and being mad at their colleagues breaking the code everytime they want to add a feature.

Your project manager asks you to write unit tests to fix the problem.

## **Must-have features¶**
All the functions have to get at least one test.
Use the Mock object
Use pytest at least once

## **Nice-to-have features**
Folow pep8 rules.
Add a docstring for each test.
Add type hinting for all your tests.
Use Black to format your code.
Use pytest for all your tests
Try to mix pytest and unittest
Create your own fixture
Use parametrization
